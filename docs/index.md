[Repository Link](https://github.com/prishasheth/Tower-Defense-Game)<br>
<em>Skills: Mobile Application Development, Android Studio Programming, Graphic Design, Collaboration</em><br><br>
For Georgia Tech's CS2340 class, I created and implemented a tower defense game using Android Studio. The game featured three levels of difficulty, allowing players to choose their preferred level of challenge. To make the gameplay engaging, I implemented enemy attack functionality, where waves of enemies would attempt to reach the player's base and inflict damage. Players had to strategically place towers along the enemy's path to defend their base and prevent the enemies from reaching it. In the game, players had the option to purchase different types of towers with varying abilities and strengths. The interface was designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for the players.<br><br>

<em>Skills: HTML, CSS, Node.js, React, SQL</em><br><br>
I developed a comprehensive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL that served as a platform for a Pay-For-A's service. The primary focus of the website was to connect students with tutors whom they could hire for academic assistance. One of the key features of the website was the login and logout functionality, allowing users to securely access their accounts and manage their tutoring sessions. To support the website's functionality, I implemented a robust backend using Node.js. The backend facilitated the interaction between the frontend and the database, allowing seamless communication and data management. It played a vital role in handling user requests, managing session data, and ensuring a smooth user experience. The website also incorporated a payment service. This enabled students to conveniently make payments for the tutoring services they received. The integration of a secure and reliable payment system enhanced the overall user experience and provided a seamless transaction process. To store and manage user data, I utilized SQL, a powerful database management system. By designing and implementing an efficient database schema, I ensured the proper storage and retrieval of user information, tutor profiles, and transaction records.<br><br>

- **Game Boy Advance**<br>
<em>Skills: C, GBA, Graphic Design</em><br><br>
I developed an interactive C program specifically tailored for the Game Boy Advance emulator, demonstrating my expertise in low-level programming with C. This project showcased my ability to work at the hardware level, as I utilized techniques like accessing hard-coded memory addresses to directly interface with the emulator's components. By leveraging such techniques, I created a seamless gaming experience with smooth graphics rendering, responsive input handling, and immersive audio playback. To optimize performance, I employed Direct Memory Access (DMA) to efficiently transfer data between memory sections, ensuring minimal slowdowns and maximizing overall gameplay quality. This project highlighted my proficiency in low-level programming, resource management, and my ability to create engaging experiences within hardware limitations.<br><br>

### **Experience**

- **Intel Corporation - Software Engineer Intern**
    - Implemented IPPSS driver submission to Microsoft HW Dev Center for Pre-Production signing, a critical step in the driver development process. To ensure the stability and reliability of the submission flow, a Mock Dev Center was created within IPPSS. This allowed comprehensive end-to-end testing, simulating real-world scenarios and emulating the behavior of the actual Microsoft HW Dev Center. Through this approach, potential issues and edge cases were identified and addressed early in the development cycle, leading to a more stable and polished driver submission process.
    - Developed essential functionalities for seamless driver management within the Windows Dev Center. First, the capability to obtain SAS URLs was integrated, enabling secure and time-limited access to storage resources for uploading driver files. Second, a file upload triggering mechanism was implemented, allowing efficient and straightforward initiation of driver uploads to the Windows Dev Center. Lastly, a robust system for retrieving signed drivers from the Windows Dev Center was established, ensuring that the final signed drivers could be securely and reliably fetched for further deployment and distribution. These functionalities streamlined the driver management process, simplifying tasks for developers and ensuring a smooth flow from submission to distribution.
    - Ensured robust security measures by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms through OAuth 2.0 and JWT. OAuth 2.0 provided a standardized approach for secure user authentication, allowing users to log in to the application securely. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) were used to handle authorization, ensuring that only authorized users could access specific resources and functionalities within the application. This multi-layered security approach protected sensitive data and valuable application resources, safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential security threats. By adopting these industry-standard security protocols, the application maintained a high level of protection and user confidence in its reliability.
