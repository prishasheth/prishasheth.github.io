              I developed and conducted a Python course catered towards beginners, with a focus on reaching out to underrepresented groups in STEM. The course attracted over 50 students, with a majority being female participants. By introducing them to the fundamentals of coding and Python, this initiative aimed to ignite their interest in programming and inspire them to pursue careers in engineering and STEM fields. Through hands-on exercises and interactive sessions, the course empowered these students to develop valuable coding skills and provided them with a strong foundation to further explore the world of programming.

              I actively collaborated with fellow council members and faculty to make informed decisions for our school. By fostering open communication and considering diverse perspectives, we worked towards creating a positive and inclusive environment. Through our collective efforts, we set a strong example through our behavior, adhering to expected norms and promoting discipline and decorum among students. These initiatives significantly contributed to increased student morale, creating a conducive learning atmosphere and enhancing the overall school experience.
